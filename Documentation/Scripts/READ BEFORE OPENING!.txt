Hello.

This is Cole, the Creative Director and writer of the story for THE WESTERN FRONTIER.

I just wanted to make a few things clear before you proceed to read the script.

1.) Everything is subject to change and NOT FINAL until the game ships.
2.) DO NOT EDIT without the express and direct permision from myself.
3.) DO NOT share anywhere.

That is all.

Thank you and enjoy the script!
